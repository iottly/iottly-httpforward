# iottly-httpforward
The *iottly-httpforward* project is an [Openfire](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire) plugin that forwards message packets to an HTTP endpoint.
Please refer to [README.html](https://github.com/iottly/iottly-httpforward/blob/master/readme.html) for further documentation.

The plugin *iottly-httpforward* comes already packaged and installed within the [iottly-xmpp-broker](https://github.com/iottly/iottly-xmpp-broker), so you don't need this repo unless you want to change the plugin.
